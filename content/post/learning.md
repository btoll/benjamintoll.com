### Life lessions, mostly from my dad.

- Do the things that are hard.
- Do the things that no one else wants to.
- Do what scares you.
- Don't take yourself too seriously.  Better, don't take much of anything very seriously.
- Read books.
- Question everything, but don't be a dick about it.
- Don't put anyone on a pedestal.
- Life is absurd.

And, from Billy Joel: "Don't take any shit from anybody."

### About computers and programming:

- Remember your ABCs (Always Be Coding)!
- Always use the command line and eschew GUIs.
- Learn a systems programming language, a server-side scripting language and a front-end language. Prefer the former.
- Explore functional programming and then embrace its philosophy.
- Watch videos for conceptual ideas but read for understanding.
- Don't use cloud services for personal projects.
- Get to know your tools intimately.
- Know TCP/IP.
- Use Vim :)

The End.
