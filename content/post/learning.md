Of course, this is a work in progress...

### Life lessions, mostly from my dad.

- Do the things that are hard.
- Do what scares you.
- Read books.
- Question everything.

### About computers and programming.

- Remember your ABCs (Always Be Coding)!
- Read source code and man pages and RFCs and docs.
- Use the command line.
- Learn a systems programming language (if a frontend developer).
- Get to know your tools intimately.
- Know Unix.
- Know TCP/IP.
- Know public key cryptography.
- Use Vim :)

The End.
