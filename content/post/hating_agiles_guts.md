I remember the first time I was fully exposed to Agile.

I was working for a company outside of Boston, it was my first day, and I was introduced to someone called a Scrum Master.  Ok, whatever, our industry has a lot of terms and buzzwords, and I didn't give it much thought.  Then, along came Friday.  As we all shuffled into a well-lit conference room, I noticed the Post-It notes and magic markers on a table next to one of the whiteboards, which my new co-workers were all taking with varying levels of enthusiasm.

I grabbed my fair share and asked the natural question.  "You're to write down things you felt went well", came the response, "as well as things you felt didn't go well and suggestions on how we can improve."

"Well, we can just talk to each other without this bit of silliness", I thought but didn't say out loud, it being my first week and all.

I then was distracted by the Scrum Master, who at this time chose to make his appearance, carrying what looked like a stick with feathers attached to the upper end.

That's when all the Native American references started appearing.  What is this, and why would they shamelessly incorporate Native American culture into their business practices?

Is this really only my first week?  [I think I've made a huge mistake].

Since then, I haven't worked anywhere that had that level of pageantry, but every company used Agile to one degree or another.  New buzzwords, new faces, same results, at least as far as I was concerned.

And, what were those results?  The same as all the places I worked that didn't use Agile.  Some weeks were better than others (of course, it depends upon how you define "better").  Some tickets were worked, others were studiously avoided.  Many issues came up that weren't anticipated.  Some people communicated well, others didn't.

I just didn't see that much difference, other than the fact that there's all this new goofy language that I'm supposed to use to discuss things that we already had perfectly good words for.  And people are serious about Agile.  Very Serious.

I've witnessed Scrum Masters get visibly angry when Agile isn't followed correctly, or "correctly" as they've defined it.

Not that anger is necessarily a bad thing.  For instance, where's all the anger at ~~yet more human self-aggrandizement~~ this nonsense?  Oh my, that all happens privately.

I've never spoken to a single person that felt that Agile was a good methodology or that it lived up to its promise.  This includes both individual contributors and managers (of course, to be fair, I didn't ask any Scrum Masters or those in thrall to Agile).  Not one of them felt like it made a bit of difference or that it increased productivity (again, it depends on how you define "productivity"), but in public?  Not a peep.

Everyone just plays along, taking it very seriously.  We all just nod along like bobbleheads.  It's all very mysterious...

Here are some results of using Agile that I've seen play out numerous times at different companies.  They are all interrelated and connected, just like our faerie spirits!

- **Decreased productivity**

    Ostensibly, Agile gets features to the users quicker than ever before in the history of humankind.  However, my experience with Agile has been that it creates mountains and mountains of technical debt.  But don't worry, there's a ticket(s) for that, it's in the backlog.  And how often do we get to those tickets?  Well, we don't, because fixing technical debut Doesn't Provide Value to the Customer.

    Then comes that inevitable day when even the manager concedes that the codebase has turned into an enormous steaming pile of manure, and now you can't get that feature out the door that Sales and Marketing over-promised because of it.

    Ah, the unfairness of it all!

- **Increased laziness**

    + **Begin Scene**: During the "Sprint", I submit a pull request with an easy fix of some outstanding technical debt.
    + **Agile Guy**: "Whoa, what's this?"
    + **Me**: "Oh, it's just some technical debt that I fixed."
    + **Agile Guy**: "Whoa, is this in your Sprint?"
    + **Me**: "It needs to be in my Sprint?"
    + **Agile Guy**: "Hey, we all agreed at the start of the Sprint on what our tickets should be."
    + **Me**: "I don't see what the problem is."
    + **Agile Guy**: "Well, there's no ticket for this."
    + **Me**: "I don't know how I could have possibly foreseen this.  Does it need to have a ticket?  It didn't take long at all to fix, can't we just review it and merge?"
    + **Agile Guy**: "Tell you what, bring this up in today's Standup and we'll discuss it in the Parking Lot!  Maybe we can create an Epic!"
    + **Me**: "..."
    + **Agile Guy**: "And, add it to the Backlog!"
    + **Annnnnnnnd End Scene**

    So, today I learned that I don't have to do anything I don't want to do because It's Not in the Sprint.  Brilliant!

    ( Bonus points if you're also told that it's not on the Roadmap. )

- **Decreased trust**

    Why are you asking me what's in my Sprint?  Are you genuinely interested or are you keeping tabs on me?

    Personally, I don't usually care beyond a mild interest what you're working on.  If you're blocked, I trust that you'll ask for help.  If you fix something, whether it's in the Sprint or not, I'm not going to question you and wonder if it took time away from some other task.  I'll just figure it was worth it, and I'll be glad that you have the drive and desire to fix things as you come across them.

    I want to work with people like that.

    Sometimes that get-up-and-go attitude, which should be highly-prized, is perceived as a bad thing that is a burden for others, I guess because Agile rules have been broken.  It makes no sense to me.

    What happens if your Sprint work "rolls over" into the next Sprint?  Well, nothing, that's software development, isn't it?  Unexpected things come up, and we nod and say "Yep, that always happens", and then we'll have ourselves a nice little chuckle.

    However, depending upon Agile and the rich ambiguous metrics that it offers, you just *might* instead get a warning that this has happened before and that it's negatively "impacting" the team's Velocity.

    Holy crap!

    You know what's ~~fun~~ ~~not fun~~ really awful?  Sprint planning and that poker game you have to play with the Fibonacci numbers.  This is where I get to tell you, the domain expert for a particular piece of software, how long you get to work on it.

    Think it's a 5?  Think again, because me and the rest of the team that have no idea what this code does think it's a 3!

## Conclusion

The irony is that the [principles of the Agile Manifesto] are quite reasonable, and dare I say, commonsensical.  Interestingly, even [some of the founders of the Manifesto have had the shits] of their ideas being hijacked by taskmasters and self-important people with bad ideas (usually the same person) and, most appallingly, some fellow programmers.

The problem is...human beings!  It's a shock that humans would take a simple idea and immediately complicate it.

Oh, Business!  Your crisp handshakes and even crisper suits!  Intoxicating!  You allow me my two-hour commute and position at the trough!
