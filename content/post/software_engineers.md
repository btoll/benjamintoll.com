I was walking some dogs the other day when I ran into a couple that lives down the street.  I was pretty sure that they were working from home, like me, but I had never asked before.

He told me that he was a weather guy that worked within the insurance industry, sifting through data and making predictions.  She told me that she was an engineer.

My curiosity piqued, I asked what type, and she replied that she is a chemist.

Ah, I said, you're a real engineer!  I'm a programmer who works with software engineers, I continued.

Yeah, I work with some of those people, they responded at the same time.

After a pause, we shared a big laugh.
