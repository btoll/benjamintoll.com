Today, I got rid of my mobile flip phone, and it easily become one of the best decisions I've ever made.

The first step had been to get rid of my smartphone, which I did in March 2020.  Except for a brief stint on Facebook and LinkedIn, I was never a social media guy.  It all felt very turd-ish.  And I wasn't an app guy.  So that part was easy.

And then today was when I broke the connection entirely by getting rid of the 3rd flip phone I'd had to purchase in 20 months.  And you know what?  That part was easy, too.  When you're ready, you're ready.

Having went to high school and college without a mobile phone, I had many, many years where I can prove that life **can** be lived without having a tracking device in my pocket.  And I was suddenly yearning for that time.

I missed the landline, and not the cordless type.  Sitting in a chair and giving my full attention to the person on the other end of the line was something I suddenly wanted to do again, and I hate talking on the phone.

Who am I?  Does even the Shadow know?  Does he know that I miss carrying around a book like a nerd?

Hey, I'm getting a call on the other line, can you please hold?
