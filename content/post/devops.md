Q. What is DevOps?

A. As far as I can ascertain, DevOps is filled with carbon-based lifeforms, predominantly hipsters who end an inordinate number of their sentences with ["right?"].

Members of this group are very similar in temperament and mannerism to the Frontend Engineer.

Q. Oh.  Isn't there anyone that can answer it definitively?

A. Yes, recruiters and project managers.
