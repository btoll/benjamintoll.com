Looking for a job is a stressful, painful and sometimes humiliating experience.  There are unwritten rules for behavior that amount to the company treating you and your candidacy however they want, because it's nothing personal.

That doesn't cut both ways, sadly.

The lack of communication is astounding, as is the lack of empathy.  Confusingly, there are values and unquantifiable culture fit hoops to jump through.

In my experience, the worst are the outside recruiters that work in an agency.  It's baffling how treating people like shit is seen so cavalierly, and I've heard genuine wonderment in the voices of some recruiters that I've directly questioned.
