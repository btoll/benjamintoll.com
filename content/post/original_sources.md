I have a history degree from the University of New Mexico, and one of the best lessons I learned from my professors was to always read original sources.  As soon as you read another's account of an original source, it's been filtered through what that author thinks is important (and unimportant). Biases are introduced.  Sometimes errors in interpretations and translations and judgements are made and not caught for hundreds of years.

Think that's hyperbole?  Take the famous case of the [horned Moses].

Saint Jerome, who lived from 342 - 420 CE, is credited with translating the Hebrew Bible into Latin in his renowned [`Vulgate`].  However, he mistranslated the description of Moses as he came down from Mt. Sinai after receiving the commandments, and that mistake rippled down the centuries and into the form of Michelangelo's status of Moses (c. 1513-1515 CE), replete with horns growing out of his head.

Many times, we don't even think about the implications of reading someone's account of "what happened".  After all, we're sure they have our best interests in mind.

Perhaps we're implicitly taught not to question something or to look at it too critically.  But, unlearning something comes at a high cost, and often, there's resistance and outright rebellion to change, resulting in a doubling-down on what's familiar.  Humans are only half-baked, after all.

Reading manual pages, project documentation, `RFC`s and source code is a lot of work.  It's often quite tedious and dry.  Our expectations, often the source of our unhappiness, certainly tell us so.

But, we can train ourselves to think differently.  I certainly did, and I feel that I've been transformed by it.

There is so little that we have control over.  Messages slip into our consciousness, often without our knowing and permission, influencing our next thoughts and our next choices.  And, way too often, we don't even know from where the suggestive messaging comes.  Could it be a trusted source?

Who holds our best interests?
