No one has ever asked me what I think is important to know and study when getting into the computer field, but if they did, I bet this is what I would tell them.

I'm in a fairly good position right now, but I wasn't always.  For years, I lived fearing how I'd pay my rent and my bills and fill my gas tank, all the while going further into debt.  Debts accrued merely through living.

If you've ever lived like that for an extended period of time, you'll know that it never leaves you.  It changes your way of looking at the world, introducing new fears and new anxieties.

I was lucky that I could fall back on family, and after a time I was able to completely pay off my debts.  Not everyone is so lucky, of course, and [they fall through the cracks] into lives that are ["solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short"].

I said to myself early on that I needed to get as much control over my life, and my future, as I could.  No one was going to be [looking out for number one].

I knew that this could only be done by educating myself, and so I would work jobs I hated only to come home and program and study for hours every night.

One day, it would pay off.

## Do What You Want

This is the most important thing.  If you don't enjoy what you do, then there's no point to it.

I've found it incredibly difficult to determine what I wanted.  This was compounded by the years I spent living in fear.  There was so much noise I couldn't find the signal, to use a popular turn of phrase.

I stumbled into computers blindly, after years of professing to hate them.  Well, I hated what I couldn't understand or couldn't focus on.

The fact that I'm currently writing this in Vim in a session in a terminal multiplexer in a tiled window manager in Linux is something I would never have predicted or even known existed.

So it goes.

After I "discovered" programming, there was no turning back.  I became obsessed, and obsessed I remain.  For whatever reason, society has determined that this endeavor shall pay well, in direct contradiction to those that perform the truly important work such as teachers and public utility employees that keep our fragile society chugging away.

## Whose Life Is It Anyway?

You only get one time around, and you don't want to look back on a life where you did what you were supposed to.  And by this, I mostly mean succumbed to the pressures of employers, potential employers, hiring managers, recruiters and anyone who purports to tell you what you should be doing and learning.

If you're not careful, you'll find yourself constantly chasing after the latest shiny object that everyone says you should be using.  And if you're not, it will be constantly impressed upon you that you *should* be chasing it.

Is this something you're truly interested in?  Is is something you think you *should* be interested in?  Often times, it's hard to tell.

I like to think that I've always resisted the groupthink that infests the technology world, but that would be a lie.  I've learned React, various cloud services, and other things that I've put down on my resume to make me look more "attractive" and "marketable".

I've told recruiters and hiring managers that yes, indeed, I loved their company's product and their technologies.  "Full stack" Javascript?  Yes, it *is* better than sliced bread!  So embarrassing.

I felt dirty and that I was compromising my principles to play a game, but I was too scared not to.  And fear can have you engage in all sorts of inauthentic behaviors.

In the meantime, I kept focusing on fundamentals, just like when I was in Little League.  I've had a sneaking suspicion that as long as I understood the underpinnings, whether it be the operating system or the Internet, to the best of my ability, that I could pick up anything that was running on top of it at a higher abstracted layer.  And, so far, I don't feel I've been wrong.

The best (and only?) way to find out who you are is through art.
