"True terror is to wake up one morning and discover that your high school class is running the country."

[DevOps] is acting all high and mighty.

In interviews, I'm not asked about containers or anything substantive about Linux.  I'm not asked about security or TCP/IP or coding or anything that matters.

Instead, I'm asked about [DevOps' Greatest Hits].  DevOps is obsessively focused on tools.  Some of these tools can be learned in less time than it takes to tell these DevOps "engineers" that they're focused on the wrong things.

This is completely idiotic.

What happens when something new comes along and suddenly you have to learn it?  Do you fall apart?

Here are some questions I've recently been asked:

- What is IaC?
- How well do you know Docker?
- What is Amazon SQS, SNS and MQ?
- On a scale of 1 - 10, how well do you know Python?

DevOps, if you want to be taken seriously, ask some questions that actually dig into someone's experience and give you a sense of them as a person.  Ask them what tickles their fancy.  It's not difficult.

Learning new tools and technologies is what we do in this profession (any profession?).  If someone doesn't know Ansible or Terraform or blah blah blah, don't worry fella, they'll pick it up.

I'm sorry to be the one to break it to you, DevOps, but your version of DevOps isn't difficult.  The difficult stuff is everything else you're not asking.
