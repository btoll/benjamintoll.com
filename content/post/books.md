I frequently say that I am grateful to have grown up before the public Internet began to shape and mold human beings and human interaction.  And I sometimes wonder if the Internet is a terrible thing to have happened.  Not its original vision, but as it's came to be.  Probably.

Anyway, I read books, and I use libraries.  I worked in a [library at college].  If I have the choice, I never choose an ebook over a book (and I try to order local or directly from the publisher).  And so I thought, why not compile a list of my favorite computer books?

The books that make this list satisfy two criteria:

- I continue to reread and refer to them.
- Or, I did at one point in my career.

It's a small list, as favorites can be, and I may add to it in time.
