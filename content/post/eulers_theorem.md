Euler's theorem is named after the great Swiss mathematician [Leonhard Euler] from a paper he published in 1763 containing several proofs of Fermat's little theorem.   Euler's theorem is an attempt to find the smallest possible exponent for which Fermat's little theorem is always true.

First, let's take a look at Fermat's little theorem.

Next, let's take a look at Euler's theorem.

Let's see some examples of substituting some values that are coprime into the statement.  To make calculating the phi function simple, we'll use prime numbers for `n`.

	a = 3
	n = 17

	a^ϕ(n) ≡ 1 mod n
	3^ϕ(17) ≡ 1 mod 17
	3^16 ≡ 1 mod 17
	43046721 ≡ 1 mod 17
	1 ≡ 1 mod 17

---

	a = 13
	n = 307

	a^ϕ(n) ≡ 1 mod n
	13^ϕ(307) ≡ 1 mod 307
	3^306 ≡ 1 mod 17
	# The number is too big to print, we'll use `bc`:
	~:$ bc <<< 13^306%307
	1

## Euler's Theorem in Action

So, what's the point of this?  Well, Euler's theorem can be used to easily reduce modular exponentiation with large exponents (and to exponents smaller than `n` if `n` is prime)!

For example:

	13^5921 mod 19

1. Substitute ϕ(n) for the large exponent.  Recall that `a` and `n` must be coprime!

		13^ϕ(19) ≡ 1 mod 19
		13^18 ≡ 1 mod 19

2. Use ϕ(19) to reduce the large exponent 5921 into its component parts.

		5921 / 18 = 328 r17
		Divisor   = 18
		Quotient  = 328
		Remainder = 17

3. Use the component parts to rewrite the statement.

		# Recall that n^(a*b) = (n^a)^b.
		13^(18*328+17) mod 19
		or
		((13^18)^328 + 13^17) mod 19

4. Calculate!

		// Since 1^k=1, the large exponent 328 is essentially "removed" from
		// the equation, which greatly simplifies the computation!
		1^328 * 13^17 mod 19
		1 * 13^17 mod 19
		13^17 mod 19
		3

Of course, this can be verified easily using `bc`:

	bc <<< 13^5921%19

## Euler's Theorem and Public Key Cryptography

Neat!  And this theorem has even more practical applications, as mentioned earlier, particularly with RSA in the field of cryptography.

As is now known, Euler's theorem ties together ϕ(n) (the phi function) and modular exponentiation.

1. The keys generated by RSA depend on the phi function, the result of which can only be deduced by the prime factorization of the modulus `n`, which is computationally infeasible given a large enough composite number.

2. Further, the choice of the public key `e` can only be reproduced knowing the prime numbers, which again is tied directly to ϕ(n).

	- `e` must be coprime to ϕ(n)
	- `e` must be between 1 and ϕ(n), i.e., `1 < e ϕ(n)`

3. Lastly, the private key `d` can only be reproduced knowing the public key `e` and calculating its [modular multiplicative inverse], again infeasible without knowing the initial prime numbers on which ϕ(n) depends!

	- d*e = 1 mod ϕ(n)
